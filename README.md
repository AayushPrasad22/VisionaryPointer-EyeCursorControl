# VisionaryPointer: Eye-Controlled Mouse Cursor

Control your mouse cursor using eye movements and blinks!
This project uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to track your eyes via a webcam and map them to your screen for a hands-free experience.

## ✨Features
```
Real-Time Eye Tracking using MediaPipe FaceMesh

Mouse Movement with Eye Gaze

Click with Eye Blink (left eye blink triggers a click)

Hands-Free Control for accessibility and futuristic interaction
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

- 🔹 **Face Detection**: Uses MediaPipe Face Mesh for facial landmark detection.  
- 🔹 **Eye Tracking**: Maps eye movement to screen coordinates.  
- 🔹 **Cursor Movement**: Moves the mouse pointer accordingly.  
- 🔹 **Blink Detection**: Detects eyelid distance to simulate a click.
